# RIA word typing game

This repository was made for the course "RIA-utveckling med JavaScript" (2DV407), program "Utvecklare av Digitala Utvecklare" (2011, 180P).

The application is supposed to be a word game where you type in the word that's displayed, is timed and has categories and has support for 2-3 languages, but it isn't really there yet.

This JavaScript application is a SPA (single page application) that uses:
+ Jade for template creation.
+ Backbone (MVC + others).
+ Underscore (dependency for backbone).
+ jQuery (Making it simpler).
+ RequireJS (including files in a nicer way).

Code documentation at [doc.html](http://zl222ag.github.io/RIA/doc.html).
Any help is appreciated...
