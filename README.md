# RIA word typing game

This repository was made for the course "RIA-utveckling med JavaScript" (2DV407),
program "Utvecklare av digitala tjänster" (180P, 2011).

The application is supposed to be a word game where you type in the word that's displayed,
is timed and has categories and has support for 2-3 languages, but it is sort of there.

This JavaScript application is a SPA (single page application) that uses:
+ [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade) for template creation.
+ [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) MVC + others.
+ [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) dependency for backbone.
+ [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) Making it simpler.
+ [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) including files in a nicer way.
+ [r.js](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/) minifying the code is sometimes a good thing.
+ [Backbone.localStorage](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage) localStorage for backbone!.

Any help is appreciated…
